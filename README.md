### File Transfer App for iOS

###### by Gavy Aggarwal (@itsgavy)

I created the iTransfer application in 2011 to send files between iOS devices via bluetooth. This was when applications didn't have access to the bluetooth API, so I sent files through the GameKit framework.

Features include:
* Send from Camera Roll, Music Library, or files imported from other apps
* Bluetooth Transfer: Transfer files between friends and family without an internet connection.
* File Manager: Manage the files you received, send those files to others, or even import files from other apps.
* Built in Viewer: Quickly view the files received without closing iTransfer.
* Send to Computer: Access the files you've received on a computer through iTunes File Sharing or by email.
* Background Transfer: Seamlessly send and receive files even when iTransfer is not open.
* Clean Look: iTransfer's new interface makes it easier to use and is easy on the eyes.
* Universal App: This one app works on iOS 5 and iOS 6 on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod whether it is retina or non-retina.

The application was updated to support the release of the new operating systems (up to iOS 7) and new devices (4-in iPhone, iPad, retina iPad). Due to changes in the App Store policies, this app was removed from sale in 2014.

I'm providing the source code as is for reference to anybody interested.
